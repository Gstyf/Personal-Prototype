Changelog for Prototype Project:

Test Save to see if version control mirroring works (this is pushed my my personal github page, but I have the repository mirrored to my Uppsala University Gitea account). Hopefully this will work!

Still trying to figure out the scene loading system. Got a good idea from Tommi of instead of trying to load a whole new scene, instead make all game modes their own scene nodes in a 'Game Manager' scene, and then just load and unload the other game modes as required on the Game Manager Scene. That might be easier and make more sense. Will give this a try.

I was supposed to create this changelog file last week after my meeting with the supervisor but forgot.

Was sick as a dog this week and have not been able to do much at all so will need to play catch-up over the weekend.

So, changes to plan! I will take supervisor feedback into consideration and not implement chat mechanics at this stage. Focus instead of just creating 'game mode teleporting zones'

Achieved so far: I've been able to make meshes in Blender, and import them into Godot. It was pretty painless and easy. That said: I need to figure out materials and textures, because this looks really bad. Usually completely black. I have technically got a hub. No camera following, and the hub is more of a diorama currently. Collisions are acting weird. Need to figure out how to properly work collisions into Godot from Blender meshes as currently players cannot walk on them.
