Changelog for Prototype Project:

23/10/2024:
- Added textures for the grid that will be spawned.
- Sorted the folders (not essential, but was getting hard to keep track)
- Scene transition script from Hub to TBS
- created basic map for TBS
- added tiles for Turn-Based Strategy mode (3 types, grass, ground, concrete)
- the plinths for the tower defence can now instantiate towers that shoot at enemies by clicking on them (no UI instruction for this). 

21/10/2024:
Again, forgot to update the changelog. Changes since last update:
- fixed the camera system so I can pre-place cameras in scenes instead of having to retrieve a transform to move a single camera around.
- folder clean-up for scenes.

I forgot to update this changelog for ages. Oops!
REMEBER!! I can commit to my local repository without pushing to git. Do this often.

Changes since the 28th have been:
1) I have created a level for my tower defence, it contains two paths that merge into a single one moving towards an exit. There are some trees and rocks as decor. There are plinths that will be where you can place towers to shoot at enemies.

2) I have finally implemented the working scene transition script. Currently all game modes are part of the same main scene as child nodes. The main node has a game manager script that keeps track of which is the current game mode and enables and disables script processes of in/active scripts as needed. When a game mode is changed, the main camera is moved to the spot pertinent to the level - NOTE: This is a tedious process, try to find a better way to implement this. Consider an array of cameras in main that is retrieved from each game mode child node and then toggle between them as necessary.

3) I have implemented paths and path followers (which are the enemies). They will move towards the end of the level and then disappear. Currently there is no effect of them reaching he end.

4) I have implemented defenders that have a collision sphere looking for enemies, looks at them and then shoots them. They just shoot a projectile that tracks directly towards the enemy. TODO: See if I can implement a sine wave arch to make it move more like an arrow.

TODO: Implement script to place defenders on plinths in level (consider a collision3d with a mouse position raycast to place the defender.

Test Save to see if version control mirroring works (this is pushed my my personal github page, but I have the repository mirrored to my Uppsala University Gitea account). Hopefully this will work!


27/09/2024:
Still trying to figure out the scene loading system. Got a good idea from Tommi of instead of trying to load a whole new scene, instead make all game modes their own scene nodes in a 'Game Manager' scene, and then just load and unload the other game modes as required on the Game Manager Scene. That might be easier and make more sense. Will give this a try.


26/09/2024:
I was supposed to create this changelog file last week after my meeting with the supervisor but forgot.

Was sick as a dog this week and have not been able to do much at all so will need to play catch-up over the weekend.

So, changes to plan! I will take supervisor feedback into consideration and not implement chat mechanics at this stage. Focus instead of just creating 'game mode teleporting zones'

Achieved so far: I've been able to make meshes in Blender, and import them into Godot. It was pretty painless and easy. That said: I need to figure out materials and textures, because this looks really bad. Usually completely black. I have technically got a hub. No camera following, and the hub is more of a diorama currently. Collisions are acting weird. Need to figure out how to properly work collisions into Godot from Blender meshes as currently players cannot walk on them.
